description: "Overview of this knowledgebase"

Welcome to my documentation-style knowledgebase. This space collects clear, structured notes on telecom systems (OSS, BSS, and emerging network tech), cybersecurity topics, and the tools that shape both domains. It’s a mix of practical breakdowns, research summaries, and hands-on explanations—built so anyone working in these areas can quickly understand what matters without digging through marketing fluff or vendor spin.
