## Get started in three steps

A simple walkthrough to help you explore the telecom and cybersecurity sections and understand how this knowledgebase is organized.

### Step 1: Explore the core sections

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="satellite-dish" title="Telecom fundamentals">
    Start with OSS, BSS, and core network concepts.  
    These pages cover how telecom systems operate, how networks are monitored, and how services are delivered.
    
    Head to: `/telecom/introduction`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Cybersecurity basics">
    Jump into threat overviews, security tooling, and incident patterns.  
    This section gives you a grounded sense of how modern security operations work.

    Head to: `/cybersecurity/introduction`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Dive deeper into the specialized areas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="network-wired" title="OSS & BSS deep dives">
    Break down the systems used for network operations, billing, customer management, and service delivery.  
    These pages are structured for quick reference rather than vendor-style explanations.
    
    `/telecom/oss`  
    `/telecom/bss`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="signal" title="Emerging telecom technologies">
    Explore 5G/6G, Open RAN, network automation, and cloud-native telco stacks — all explained simply and directly.

    `/telecom/emerging-tech`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Cybersecurity reports & products">
    Summaries of industry reports, tool evaluations, and practical notes on SIEM, SOAR, IAM, EDR, and more.

    `/cybersecurity/industry-reports`  
    `/cybersecurity/products`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Use the supporting material

<Accordion icon="book-open" title="Extras that help everything make sense">
  Check out documentation tips, API examples, case studies, and learning paths that tie telecom and cybersecurity together.
  
  `/writing/introduction`  
  `/api/introduction`  
  `/case-studies`  
  `/learning`
</Accordion>
