# Cybertech Knowledgebase – Glossary

| **A–Z** | **Term** | **Description** |

|:-------:|-----------|-----------------|

| **A** | Access broker | A cybercriminal who gains unauthorized access to organizations and sells that access to other criminals, enabling further attacks such as ransomware or data theft. |

|  | AI deepfake | Artificial Intelligence-generated audio, video, or images that convincingly mimic real people or events; can be used to impersonate individuals, fabricate scenarios, or manipulate public perception—often contributing to fraud, misinformation, or disinformation. |

|  | Attack surface | The total set of points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. |

| **B** | BEC (Business Email Compromise) | A targeted attack where criminals gain access to business email accounts to defraud organizations, often by manipulating financial transactions. |

|  | Botnet | A network of computers infected with malware and controlled as a group to perform malicious activities, such as launching attacks or sending spam. |

| **C** | Cloud security | Protecting data, applications, and systems hosted in cloud environments. As organizations move to the cloud, attackers increasingly target cloud assets and identities. |

|  | Cloud workload | Applications, services, or processes running in a cloud environment, which can be targeted by attackers. |

|  | Container (in cybersecurity context) | A lightweight, standalone package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. Containers are widely used in cloud environments and can be targeted by attackers if not properly secured. |

|  | Credential theft | Stealing usernames, passwords, or other authentication information to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. |

|  | Critical infrastructure | Essential systems and assets (energy, water, transportation, healthcare, etc.) whose disruption would have significant societal impact. |

|  | Cyber mercenary | A private entity that sells hacking tools or services to governments or criminals, often operating in legal gray zones. |

|  | Cyber resilience | The ability of an organization to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to cyberattacks or disruptions. |

|  | Cyber-enabled influence operations | Efforts by threat actors to manipulate public opinion or behavior using digital tools, such as social media, fake news, or deepfakes. |

| **D** | Data exfiltration | The unauthorized transfer or theft of data from an organization, often as part of a cyberattack. |

|  | Data theft | Stealing sensitive or valuable information, such as intellectual property, personal data, or financial records. |

|  | Device code phishing | A phishing technique where attackers trick users into entering authentication codes on fake portals, allowing them to hijack accounts. |

| **E** | Endpoint | Any device (such as a computer, smartphone, or server) that connects to a network and can be targeted by cyberattacks. |

|  | Espionage | The act of spying to obtain confidential information, often for political, economic, or military advantage. |

|  | Exploit | A method or tool used by attackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities in software or systems. |

| **F** | Fraud | Deceptive practices intended to gain financial or personal benefit, often involving manipulation or impersonation. |

| **H** | Human-operated attack | A cyberattack where humans, rather than automated tools, actively control the intrusion, often adapting tactics in real time. |

|  | Human-operated ransomware | A ransomware attack in which cybercriminals actively control the intrusion, moving through networks, stealing data, and manually deploying ransomware for maximum impact. These attacks are more targeted and damaging than automated ransomware, often combining extortion with data theft or disruption of critical services. |
